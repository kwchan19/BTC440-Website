        <h4>Details of Project:</h4>
        <p class = "specs"> This project was for a class in Seneca College. After learning about React, we were assigned a project to complete within around two weeks. The purpose of this project is to create a React App website that fetches data from an external source.
            Routing is used to switch between pages. We were also taught to create containers that holds data such as the navigation bar, so we don't have to copy and paste into every new page.
       <h4>Specifications: </h4>
       <p class = "specs">
            - Created four data-oriented component views: Overview, Projects, Teams, and Employees <br>
            - Learned how to use an HTTP request add-in named “axios”
             <br> - Created structural views (nav header, sidebar, main container, not found)
             <br> - Learned how to use routing to view a data-oriented component
