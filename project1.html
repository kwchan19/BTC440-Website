        <h4>Details of Project:</h4>
        <p class = "specs"> This project was for a class in Seneca College. After learning about Knockout, we were assigned a project to complete within around two weeks. The purpose of this project is to create a website that includes both normal HTML, and it's Knockout counterparts. 
                We created a simple multi-page web site that displays data. The pages has a consistent and neat appearance, and will support a small amount of functionality.
       <h4>Specifications: </h4>
       <p class = "specs">
        -   Creating a simple HTML page that loads data locally, and data acquired from a website<br>
        -   Creating the Knockout version of the local and fetched data pages <br>
        -   Using AJAX to load data from an external source <br>
        -   Using jQuery and Moment.js throughout the project
